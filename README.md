CoderNight: BlueHawaii
======================

My submission for June 2013's Coder Night.

This month I'm continuing to learn C++, and exploring setting up a cross-platform build setup with CMake and third-party dependencies. I've also done a quick ruby implementation to be sure I have the solution correct.

At the time I'm writing this README, the C++ implementation is not "exactly" complete.
